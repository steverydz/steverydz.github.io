## Taking pictures

I&rsquo;ve been a keen amateur photographer since 2015. Whilst I have no desire to make it a profession, it&rsquo;s still a very big and important part of my life. There&rsquo;s almost always a camera to hand, and if not there&rsquo;s always my phone. I take pictures every day and often [share them on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/steverydz/).

## Writing

I&rsquo;m not writing anything in particular right now, rather than just writing for writings sake. Some of it ends up on [my blog](/), some of it in my journal app, and some of it on scraps of paper that get thrown away. What I do with the writing is less important to me than the act of writing itself at the moment.
