title: Just write
---

Inspired by [a blog post from a colleague of mine](https://robinwinslow.uk/2020/11/13/i-am-a-blogger/) I&rsquo;ve decided to try my hand at blogging again. It was less than a year ago that [I said the same thing](/2019/12/07/a-new-beginning), but I fell into the trap of thinking I had nothing to write about.

Today I remembered this tweet from 2007:

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/451749712">
  &ldquo;Blogging. And blogging again. Writing is fun. Writing is fundamental. If you don&rsquo;t write, you don't know what you think.&rdquo;

I agree that writing is fundamental, especially when it comes to understanding who you are and what you think. I still have the problem of what to write about, but that is a solvable problem. As a professional web developer, enthusiastic amateur photographer and long time musician there should be no shortage of things to write about. Ultimately if I want to write, I should _just write_.
