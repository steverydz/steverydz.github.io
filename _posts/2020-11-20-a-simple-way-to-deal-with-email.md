title: A simple way to deal with email
---

I have a process for dealing with email which enables me to achieve inbox zero every time I visit my inbox. I discovered this technique whilst watching [a video of David Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMvUlLI37jM), the founder of [the GTD methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com/). After putting this idea into practice I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s had a positive impact on my peace of mind and productivity.

### Clearing the way

The first thing I do when I open my inbox is delete anything I don&rsquo;t need. If the email requires no action or isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;ll need to refer back to at a later date, it&rsquo;s gone. This clears the way so I can focus on what really matters.

### Getting organised

Like most people I have labels (or folders) for each ongoing project. This is where I keep all reference materials that I may need to revisit at some point in the future.

The key to making this system work is having an **@action** label and an **@waiting** label. The reason for the @ symbol is purely so they sit at the top of my labels list.

### Defining actions

As I go through my list of emails I decide whether or not it requires an action. If does and it can be done in two minutes or less, I&rsquo;ll do it. Otherwise, if that action requires more time or resources than I have to hand, I apply the @action label and come back to it when I can move forward.

### Keeping track

Often there is email that will require an action in the future but I&rsquo;m waiting on something before I can carry it out. For this I apply the @waiting label. I&rsquo;ll also use thit label for emails I send which require a reponse. A bonus tip is to bcc yourself so you can keep track of things.

### Review

At the start and end of each day I&rsquo;ll review the contents of both these labels. Are there any actions I can take care of and am I still waiting on any reponses? Doing this gives me peace of mind so I can switch off at the end of the day and focus my attention of other aspects of my life.

### A disciplined approach

For this technique to work you need to have the discipline to review your @action and @waiting labels on a regular basis. I&rsquo;d recommend doing it at least three times a day. Your mileage may vary.

### Conclusion

After working with this method for a few weeks, I can say with confidence that it is incredibly effective. I&rsquo;ve always kept a fairly tidy inbox anyway, but I often had things waiting around in my inbox that I had no clear idea what to do with.

With this system in place I can start each day with a clear idea of what I need to be working on, and end each day with the peace of mind that I&rsquo;m already on top of things the next day.
