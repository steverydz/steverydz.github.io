description: Where I talk about the reasons behind the simple design of my blog

As I [mentioned a couple of days ago](/2020/11/15/just-write), I&rsquo;ve started blogging again. This meant I had to have a working website, and that website required some level of design.

Usually I&rsquo;d get carried away and spend weeks agonising over the minor details, which ultimately gets in the way of me publishing anything. This time I thought I&rsquo;d do things differently.

The first thing I did was put together a basic site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), purely because it makes publishing to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) so simple. Then I added as little CSS as I could to make the site a bit easier on the eye and nicer to read. I really didn&rsquo;t add much.

At the time of writing this site serves it&rsquo;s purpose. It allows me to publish content without friction and hopefully provides a good reading experience for anyone who happens to be viewing the site.

I do intend to spend some time improving the typography, as well as making any other visual changes that will enhance the site, but for now, this is good enough.
