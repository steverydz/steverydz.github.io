description: Where I talk about restarting my blog

This is that hello world post that people do when they start a new blog, only this isn&rsquo;t a new blog. I started this back in 2007 although the focus has certainly shifted. It used to be about music and over time morphed into a blog about web development.

I&rsquo;ve decided to start again from scratch. Pretty much all of the content I&rsquo;d previously published is outdated and irrelevant today. I&rsquo;ve got some ideas of projects that I intend to work on and it might be cool to document their progress. We&rsquo;ll see. Until next time&hellip;
