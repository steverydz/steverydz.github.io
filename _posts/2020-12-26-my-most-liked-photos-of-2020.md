title: My most liked photos of 2020

<script src="/js/lazysizes.min.js" defer></script>

I&rsquo;m a keen amateur photographer and have been taking photography seriously since around 2015. Most of the time I&rsquo;ve been taking pictures was spent in central London. This past year has made that impossible and for a while I was a bit lost, not knowing what or where I wanted to photograph.

After going crazy at home photographing objects around the house, I started going on walks within a two mile radius of my home. On these walks I took a small camera with me and documented what I saw. Some of these pictures were later [published as a photo zine](https://steverydz.bigcartel.com/product/safe-distance-zine).

With each walk I published a selection of the photos I took to Instagram. They weren&rsquo;t always the best pictures, but they were a document of what I witnessed.

As the year is drawing to a close I thought it would be nice to publish the most liked photographs here, and linked to their respective posts.

I find it interesting that the posts with the most likes are not necessarily images that I&rsquo;m overly proud of. Maybe it&rsquo;s a matter of taste, or maybe it&rsquo;s simply that some posts got more eyes on them than others. Either way, I&rsquo;m proud to present my most liked Instagram photos of 2020.
