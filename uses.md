It seems to be a common trait among tech geeks to want to know what their peers are using on a day to day basis, so I&rsquo;ve put some information about this below.

The above photo is of my current workspace. I started working remotely, like the majority of office-based workers, at the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Initially I wasn&rsquo;t really setup for it. After making do for a while I decided to invest in [setting up a proper working space](/2020/11/17/my-remote-working-setup).
