Hi, my name is Steve and this is my personal website. Here I write about all kinds of subjects but primarily topics relating to web development, photography and music.

I currently work as a web developer at [Canonical](https://canonical.com), the company behind [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com). Any opinions expressed here are my own and not those of my employer.

You might be interested to know that I [published a photography zine](https://steverydz.bigcartel.com/product/safe-distance-zine) earlier this year. It&rsquo;s a collection of black and white images which document the area I live in during the [covid-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic).

If you would like to contact me for any reason feel free to [reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/steverydz) or send an email to [steverydz@gmail.com](mailto:steverydz@gmail.com).
